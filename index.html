            <li><strong>Carpooling Management System:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/your-github-link/carpooling-management-system" target="_blank">Carpooling Management System</a>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Engineered an innovative, dynamic Carpooling Management System that empowers users to effortlessly find, schedule, and share rides. Leveraging a robust REST API architecture and employing JWT-based authentication for seamless and secure user access, this solution ensures user privacy and data integrity. The backend, powered by SQL, effectively manages user profiles, ride schedules, and carpool routes, while maintaining optimal performance and scalability. Designed with efficiency and user experience in mind, this platform promotes eco-friendly commuting solutions while offering a frictionless user interface.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Image Caption Generation:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/your-github-link/image-caption-generation" target="_blank">Image Caption Generation</a>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Pioneered an advanced Image Caption Generation system that leverages the power of deep learning to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. By meticulously comparing the performance of two leading modelsâ€”Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformersâ€”this project delves into their respective strengths in terms of accuracy, training time, and caption relevancy. Implemented using cutting-edge frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras, the system demonstrates remarkable proficiency in generating human-like captions, pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence in image recognition and language generation.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>CafÃ© Management System:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/your-github-link/cafe-management-system" target="_blank">CafÃ© Management System</a>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Crafted a sophisticated CafÃ© Management System using Swift for the intuitive front-end design and Java for the scalable backend architecture, offering a seamless solution for cafÃ© owners to manage orders, inventory, and customer interactions. The system supports real-time order tracking, optimizing operational efficiency while delivering an exceptional user experience. The SQL-powered database ensures smooth handling of customer data, inventory management, and order processing, allowing businesses to streamline their operations, reduce wait times, and enhance overall service quality. This solution balances user-friendly design with powerful backend functionalities for a truly modern cafÃ© experience.</p>
